# Academic Success Predictor
Machine Learning project for cs 171 final

This academic success predictor tool accurately predicts whether a student will graduate or dropout of college.
The tool processes student data input by the user and utilizes a trained feed-forward neural network to predict 
on the input data. The tool then outputs a message whether the student is more likely to graduate or dropout.

The image above is after the user inputting the student data and pressing the button to predict on the data.
After predicting on the data, the model predicts that the student is going to graduate based on the input data 
processed by the model.
